# PiicoDev® Radio MicroPython Module

This is the firmware repo for the [Core Electronics PiicoDev® Radio](https://core-electronics.com.au/catalog/product/view/sku/CE08757)

This module depends on the [PiicoDev Unified Library](https://github.com/CoreElectronics/CE-PiicoDev-Unified), include `PiicoDev_Unified.py` in the project directory on your MicroPython device.

See the [Quickstart Guide](https://piico.dev/p27)

<!-- TODO verify the tested-devices list
This module has been tested on:
 - Micro:bit v2
 - Raspberry Pi Pico
 - Raspberry Pi SBC
-->

## Initialisation

### `PiicoDev_Radio(bus=, freq=, sda=, scl=, address=0x1A, id=, frequency=None)`

| Parameter      | Type                     | Range             | Default                               | Description
| -------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------- | ------------------------------------- | -----------
| bus            | int                      | 0,1               | Raspberry Pi Pico: 0, Raspberry Pi: 1 | I2C Bus. Ignored on Micro:bit.
| freq           | int                      | 100 to 1000000    | Device dependent                      | I2C Bus frequency (Hz). Ignored on Raspberry Pi.
| sda            | Pin                      | Device Dependent  | Device Dependent                      | I2C SDA Pin. Implemented on Raspberry Pi Pico only.
| scl            | Pin                      | Device Dependent  | Device Dependent                      | I2C SCL Pin. Implemented on Raspberry Pi Pico only.
| address        | int                      | 0x1A, 0x08 - 0x77 | 0x1A                                  | Manually specify the address of the connected device. For when a software address is set on the device.
| id             | List[int, int, int, int] | 1=ON, 0=OFF       | [0,0,0,0]                             | Hardware switches change the device address - Abstracts the need for user to look up an address, simply input the switch positions. Alternatively, use `address` for explicit address.

## Properties

### `.radio_address`

(default=0) is an arbitrary name, expressed as an integer, that's used to filter incoming packets, keeping only those that match the address you set. The default used by other micro:bit related platforms is the default setting used here.

### `.length`

(default=32) defines the maximum length, in bytes, of a message sent via the radio. It can be up to 251 bytes long (254 - 3 bytes for S0, LENGTH and S1 preamble).

### `.queue`

(default=3) specifies the number of messages that can be stored on the incoming message queue. If there are no spaces left on the queue for incoming messages, then the incoming message is dropped.

### `.channel`

(default=7) can be an integer value from 0 to 255 (inclusive) that defines an arbitrary "channel" to which the radio is tuned. Messages will be sent via this channel and only messages received via this channel will be put onto the incoming message queue.

### `.power`

(default=6) is an integer value from 0 to 7 (inclusive) to indicate the strength of signal used when broadcasting a message. The higher the value the stronger the signal, but the more power is consumed by the device. The numbering translates to positions in the following list of dBm (decibel milliwatt) values: -30, -20, -16, -12, -8, -4, 0, 4.

### `.group`

(default=0) is an 8-bit value (0-255) used with the `address` when filtering messages. Conceptually, "address" is like a house/office address and "group" is like the person at that address to which you want to send your message.

### `.data_rate`

(default=radio.RATE_1MBIT) indicates the speed at which data throughput takes place. Can be one of the following contants defined in the ``radio`` module : `RATE_250KBIT`, `RATE_1MBIT` or `RATE_2MBIT`.

## Methods

### `.on()`

Turns the radio on. This needs to be explicitly called since the radio draws power and takes up memory that you may otherwise need.

### `.off()`

Turns off the radio, thus saving power and memory.

### `.send(message)`

Sends a message string. This is the equivalent of send_bytes(bytes(message, 'utf8'))

### `.receive()`

### `.write_reg(reg_address, value)`
Writes to a specific register in the the RFM69 

Works in exactly the same way as receive_bytes but returns whatever was sent.
Currently, it’s equivalent to str(receive_bytes(), 'utf8').
