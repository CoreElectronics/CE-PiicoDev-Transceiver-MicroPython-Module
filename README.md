## Initialisation

### `PiicoDev_Transceiver(bus=, freq=, sda=, scl=, address=0x1A, id=, channel=0, radio_address=1, speed=2, radio_frequency=922, tx_power=20, suppress_warnings=False)`

| Parameter         | Type                     | Range             | Default                               | Description
| ----------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------- | ------------------------------------- | -----------
| bus               | int                      | 0,1               | Raspberry Pi Pico: 0, Raspberry Pi: 1 | I2C Bus. Ignored on Micro:bit.
| freq              | int                      | 100 to 1000000    | Device dependent                      | I2C Bus frequency (Hz). Ignored on Raspberry Pi.
| sda               | Pin                      | Device Dependent  | Device Dependent                      | I2C SDA Pin. Implemented on Raspberry Pi Pico only.
| scl               | Pin                      | Device Dependent  | Device Dependent                      | I2C SCL Pin. Implemented on Raspberry Pi Pico only.
| address           | int                      | 0x1A, 0x08 - 0x77 | 0x1A                                  | Manually specify the address of the connected device. For when a software address is set on the device.
| id                | List[int, int, int, int] | 1=ON, 0=OFF       | [0,0,0,0]                             | Hardware switches change the device address - Abstracts the need for user to look up an address, simply input the switch positions. Alternatively, use `address` for explicit address.

| speed             | int                      | 1, 2, 3           | 2                                     | See `.speed` property for more information.

| tx_power          | int                      | -2 to 20 dB       | 20                                    | See `.tx_power` property for more information.
| suppress_warnings | bool                     |                   | False                                 | If True, warnings will be suppressed

## Properties

### `.speed`
| Number | Baudrate (kbps) | Useage
| ------ | --------------- | ------
| 1      | 9.6             | Slower, longer range
| 2      | 115.2           | Balanced speed and range (default)
| 3      | 300             | Fastest, short range.

Example Usage:
``` Python
radio.speed = 1 # I want long range
print(radio.speed)
```

### `.radio_frequency`
Choose what frequency the radio will operate at. All radios must be tuned to the same frequency to communicate. Choose between 915, 918, 922(default), 925, 228.

Example Usage:
``` Python
radio.radio_frequency = 918 # I have interference at the default 922 MHz
print(radio.radio_frequency)
```

### `.tx_power`
Set the transmitter power

Example Usage:
``` Python
radio.tx_power = -2 # I don't want to interfeare with nearby devices
print(radio.tx_power)
```

## Methods
### `.off()`

Turns off the radio.

### `.on()`

Turns the radio on.

### `.send(message, value, destination radio address)`

Sends a message string.

#### Examples

`radio.send('Hello')`

`radio.send('TempC', 25.0)`

`radio.send('Counter', 9)`

`radio.send('secret', radio_address=7)`

### `.receive()`

Checks for a new message.

``` Python
if radio.receive():
    if (radio.type == 3): 
        print(radio.message)
    else:
        print(radio.name, radio.value)
```

### Set or Get RFM69 Register Values

`value = radio.get_rfm69_register(0x29)`

`radio.set_rfm69_register(0x29, 221)`


## Payload

Note that when transmitting, no RSSI or from_radio_address from is sent, so:

Tx Position = Rx Position - 2


| Name                      | Rx Position | Bytes | Range        | Description
| ------------------------- | ----------- | ----- | ------------ | -----------
| rssi                      | 0           | 1     | 0 to 255     | RSSI (module negates the value)
| source_radio_address      | 1           | 1     | 0 to 127   | Source Radio Address
| type                      | 3           | 1     | 0 - 3        | Type of message (0: invalid, 1: key, int, 2: key, float, 3: message string)

If the type is 1 or 2:

| Name                      | Rx Position | Bytes | Range        | Description

| length                    | 8           | 1     |              | Key length
| key                       | 9           | <=55  | 55 chars max | key

If the type is 3:

Outstanding Issues:
Tx Power doesn't seem to make any difference
Now that we are using the radio's built-in addressing scheme, need to make it so that we send the from
